# Iris Flower Classification using SVM and Decision Trees
This repository contains Python code for building and evaluating Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree models to classify Iris flowers based on their features. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset commonly used for practice in machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, and Petal width for three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset is loaded from the "iris.data" file.

## Requirements
To run the code, you will need the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- seaborn

## Content
- Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data analysis, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- iris.data: Dataset file containing the Iris data in CSV format.

## Model Performance
The performance of the SVM and Decision Tree models is evaluated using accuracy score and classification reports. The accuracy score is calculated for both models on the test dataset.

## Prediction
The trained Decision Tree model is used to make predictions on new samples. Two samples are provided in the code, and the model predicts their species based on the feature measurements.

Feel free to explore the code and datasets to gain insights into the classification process of Iris flowers using SVM and Decision Trees. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out!
