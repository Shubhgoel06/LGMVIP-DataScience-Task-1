## Iris Flower Classification using SVM and Decision Trees
This repository contains Python code for building and evaluating Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree models to classify Iris flowers based on their features. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset commonly used for practice in machine learning.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, and Petal width for three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset is loaded from the "iris.data" file.

# Requirements
To run the code, you will need the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
sklearn
seaborn
